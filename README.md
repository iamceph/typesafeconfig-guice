# Typesafe Config Guice
Allows [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) to @Inject configuration values into your application derived from [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config).

[![Build Status](https://ci.screamingsandals.org/job/typesafeconfig-guice/badge/icon?style=flat-square)](https://ci.screamingsandals.org/job/typesafeconfig-guice)

Available on [ScreamingRepo](https://repo.screamingsandals.org/com/github/racc/typesafeconfig-guice/).
 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.racc</groupId>
    <artifactId>typesafeconfig-guice</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Quickstart
#### Step 1:
Annotate configuration injection points (Constructors, Providers, Provider methods, Setter methods, Fields) with ```@TypesafeConfig("config.path.key")```

#### Step 2:
Bootstrap your application with Guice and the TypesafeConfigModule.
Configuration values annotated with `@TypesafeConfig` will be scanned for on the classpath, and then bound from your supplied Typesafe Config file.
```java
Config config = ConfigFactory.load("config.conf");
Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(
	TypesafeConfigModule.fromConfigWithPackage(config, "com.my.package");
	// ... Add your other modules here
);
```

#### Step 3:
Profit!

### Features
- Plain Old Java Objects which follow JavaBean conventions (zero-args constructor, getters and setters) can be injected. 
- Supports injections of `java.time.Duration` objects with config parameters defined as "10 seconds", "10 minutes" etc.
- Supports injections of `com.typesafe.config.ConfigMemorySize` objects with config parameters defined as "512k" or "2M" etc.
- Supports injections of `boolean`, where the matching config parameter can be "true", "false", "yes" or "no".
- Supports injections of List types of primitives: `boolean`, `int`, `double`, `long`, `string`, `java.time.Duration`, `com.typesafe.config.ConfigMemorySize`
- Supports injections of `java.util.Map<String, Object>`
- Supports injections of POJO Lists.
- Extensive test coverage
